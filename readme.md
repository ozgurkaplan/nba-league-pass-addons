# Nba League Pass Addons

Nba league pass shows briefly a spoiler image in replays. The image always has player from the winning team which kills the excitement. This add-on hides this image. There is also another issue when watching the game in fullscreen. The progress bar and stream selector stays on top of the stream. With this addon you can hide these by pressing h and reenable it by pressing s.

## Installation

Install Greasemonkey or Tempermonkey to your desired browser and add NbaLeaguePassAddons.js to your scripts.
